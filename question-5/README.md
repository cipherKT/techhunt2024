# AnArchivedMemory

Waiting for her message. I spend the night, <br>
In silent __derision__ and all my might,<br>
But something else is more important, it seems,<br>
And my hopes are shattered like dreams.<br>

I know she's not upset, but she's just busy,<br>
Her time is precious, and I'm not a priority,<br>
For her, there are other things that matter,<br>
And I'm just another voice, that she can scatter.<br>

Maybe I don't know where I stand in her life,<br>
How important I am compared to her strife,<br>
But still, I think of her, every single day,<br>
Waiting for her message, in every possible way<br>
